While this project is currently successful and working, the following
things might be interesting things to follow up on.

 * Allow easier tweaking of parameters
   - number of circles in world
   - population size
   - crossover and mutation rates
 * Display algorithm information as text on graphics screen instead of
   in the console
 * Optimize the drawing by not always drawing the world circles
 * Rewrite graphics portion to use straight OpenGL
 * Add some key controls
   - start/stop evolution
   - restart the simulation
   - adjust crossover and mutation rates
