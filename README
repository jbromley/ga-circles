GA Circles
==========

This is a genetic algorithm solution to the ``Tiddlywinks'' problem presented
on the AI Junkie web site (http://ai-junkie.com/ga/intro). It is written in
Lisp and uses SDL for graphics display.

== Problem ==

The problem is to find the largest circle that will fit into open space
between a number of other circles in the environment. First a world is created
with a random number of non-overlapping circles of random sizes. The algorithm
then tries to find the largest circles that will fit in the remaining space.

== Solution ==

This solution uses a genetic algorithm with a binary encoding and a simple
one-point crossovwer algorithm.
